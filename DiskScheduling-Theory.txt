1.There can be Multiple Platters per Disk
2.Each Platter has 2 surface (Up and down) on which it can store data
3.A spindle is used to rotate the Platters
4.A read - write head is used for each platter.

5.Each Platter has many tracks (Concentric circles)
6.The time needed for the R/W head to go to intended track is called SEEK TIME.

7.Each Track consists of many sectors (In circular format).
8.Sector is the smallest unit in disk , where the data is stored.

9.R/W head can only move linearly (front and back) , so go to an intended sectors
  First it goes to needed track and then spindle turns to needed sector.

10.The time for platter to rotate for needed sector is ROTATE LATENCY.

11.After getting the intended sector, we can do data transfer -> time - TRANSFER TIME

12.Total Seek Time = Total head Movement * Seek Time

13.Disk Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency + Transfer Time

14.Disk Response Time = Disk Access Time + Time in Queueing/Disk delay
